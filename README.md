> Deprecated! A new version of the Yo Dashboard has been released since I published this extension. Thankfully, the new Yo Dashboard has a proper 'View API key' button, so there's no reason to keep this extension up-to-date.

Hides Yo API Tokens at Yo Dashboard. You can use the 'key' icon to toggle token visibility.

Visit the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yoapitokenconcealer/ppighfjillpiooofipeeihdnkibalnpm) to install the extension.
